Northline is a JavaScript library that creates SVG maps of Canada's provinces and territories from GeoJSON.
It's a small modification of the U.S. version, Landline, by ProPublica.
It comes with Stateline, also by ProPublica, which makes creating responsive U.S. state and county maps easy.

### Forked from Landline and Stateline by ProPublica
Documentation for Landline: http://propublica.github.io/landline
Issues or questions about Landline and Stateline: https://github.com/propublica/landline/issues

### Alterations from Landline
Northline uses the same basic structure with some alterations.
* You can simply swap in your data as a JSON array called `mapData`. Be sure to specify the province or territory.
* Tooltips are styled as white-on-black, semi-transparent boxes
